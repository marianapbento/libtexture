# libtexture
This repository has the purpose to extract statistical texture features from 2D or 3D image. These features may be computed in the entire input image or just considering regions of interest (with non-specific shape, given by a binary array in the same shape of the input image).

Several texture approaches are included in this library:
- histogram
- gray level gradient
- gray level co-occurrence matrix
- run length matrix

The files above where made to me used in the jupyter-notebook platform. The user is strongly advised to install such platform and run them in the cited environment.
